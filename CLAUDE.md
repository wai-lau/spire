# THE SPIRE

Spiral tower defence at `wai-lau.net/spire` (`/aspira` 301s to it; files, code
and the nav key keep the name `aspira`). Full design, balance and every trap:
**ARCHITECTURE.md** (this repo).

## Where this repo lives

A git SUBMODULE of exec-fn at `apps/spire` (since 2026-10-14). It MIRRORS
exec-fn's layout, so the parent finds each piece the way it finds its own
(exec-fn ARCHITECTURE.md §1e):

| Here | Served / loaded as |
|------|--------------------|
| `api/routes_aspira.py`, `spire_board.py`, `spire_perflog.py` | python on exec-fn's `sys.path` (`api/app_paths.py`) |
| `api/templates/aspira.html` | `pages._tmpl("aspira.html")` |
| `web/aspira-*.{js,css}`, `aspira-version.txt` | flat at `/` (`/aspira-game.js`) |
| `tests/test_spire_*.py` | collected by exec-fn's pytest |
| `scripts/spire-smoke/`, `scripts/aspira-sim/` | the game smoke + balance simulator |

The python imports exec-fn modules (`auth`, `helpers`, `routers`, `pages`):
this repo runs only INSIDE exec-fn. Runtime data stays in exec-fn's
`api/data/` (`spire_ascendants*`, `spire-perflog/`, `aspira-sfx/`).

## Working here

- **Commit in this repo** (`git -C apps/spire commit …` from exec-fn). exec-fn's
  push hook pushes it, then bumps + pushes exec-fn's pointer. Never edit the
  files through exec-fn's index.
- **Pre-commit is exec-fn's** (symlinked in by its session hook): lints,
  500-line cap, cache-bust (`?v=` in `aspira.html` bumps with the asset), the
  game smoke (`node scripts/spire-smoke/smoke.mjs`) and the tests.
- **Tests:** from exec-fn, `.venv/bin/pytest apps/spire/tests` (the shared
  fixtures live in exec-fn's root `conftest.py`).
- **Colours** come from exec-fn's `web/chrome.css` tokens via the swatches in
  `aspira.html`; a new colour/alpha is exec-fn's palette lint's call.
- **Live edits** on the droplet are live on save, exactly as in exec-fn
  (`./apps` is bind-mounted; `--reload` covers the `.py`).
